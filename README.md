# Nice Free Treasures Shop

This is an avatar maker that anyone from any [Immers Server](https://github.com/immers-space/immers) can use
to add free avatars to their account.

It is also a demonstration project for WebCollectibles,
a non-blockhain alternative to NFTs that uses the ActiviyPub
decentralized social media fediverse as a distributed ledger.
With WebCollectibles, you can create, share, and trade digital
items with a verifiable history but without any transaction
fees or wasteful consensus work.

This is a fork of the [Hackweek Avatar Maker](https://github.com/mozilla/hackweek-avatar-maker) created by the
Mozilla Hubs team. Here's what we've added:

* Mobile responsive layout
* Treasure opening experience
* Owernship verification with ActivityPub (non-blockchain) ledger entry
* Save avatars directly to your Immers Space profile
* Multi-platform social sharing for created avatars
